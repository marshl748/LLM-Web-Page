      <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>My name is Linda.  I am a Program/Project Manager that recently moved to the Phoenix area from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania--I don't miss the snow at all.  When not working I enjoy reading, biking, cooking and just started getting into photography.</p>
      <h3>Professional Background</h3>
        <p>I originally started my IT career as a software developer creating custom ERP software for the manufacturing industry.  I worked my way up to Program and Project Management.</p>
      <h4>What brought me back to Coding?</h4>
        <p>Technology changes so rapidly today and being in managment meant technical skills were not necessarily required.  But in today's market your technical skills have to be current to be competitive.  I always enjoyed the creativity of coding and thought that Coder Camps would give me the opportunity to update my skillset as well as be creative.</p>
